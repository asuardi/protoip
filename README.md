# Protoip (IP prototyping in FPGA hardware)

**Protoip** is a utility for quickly prototyping C-based IP in FPGA hardware:
abstracting many specific low level FPGA design details, **protoip** shifts main focus to IP (algorithm) coding (C/C++ programming language), and boosts productivity.

**Protoip** provides Tcl-based functions accessible by both Xilinx Vivado Design Suite and Matlab, custom templates, examples and tutorials to support all design phases.

**Protoip** is a [Xilinx TclStore](http://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/vivado/Tcl-store.html) application and comes together with Xilinx [Vivado Design Suite](http://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/vivado/index.htm).

# Documentation

The [wiki](https://github.com/asuardi/protoip/wiki/Home) contains documentation on how to use **Protoip** from both Xilinx Vivado and Matlab software. Example designs are also available.
